QR Code Generator — Project 3

**Hello guys — this is Surya K.**  
This is a tiny, beginner-friendly QR code generator written in Python. It's simple, human-readable, and slightly different from others because it adds a small caption (text) under the generated QR image — useful for labeling.

> This project will help you learn how QR codes are made and how to create them using Python. Small steps make big milestones!

## Quick history (short & friendly)
QR codes were invented in 1994 by the Japanese company Denso Wave to track car parts during manufacturing. QR stands for **Quick Response** — designed to be scanned fast and carry more data than a normal barcode. Today they are used everywhere: payments, websites, Wi-Fi sharing, menus, and more.


## What this project does
- Generates a QR code image from a text / URL.
- Saves the QR as a PNG file.
- Adds a small caption text under the QR (slightly different and useful for labeling).
- Beginner-friendly: no complex dependencies or setup.


## Files
- `qr_generator.py` — the main script (interactive prompts).
- `requirements.txt` — required Python packages.
- `.gitignore` — to avoid committing virtual envs or secrets.
- `assets/demo.png` — (optional) demo screenshot (you can add your own).


## Installation & run (very simple)
1. Install Python 3.8+ (if not installed): https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # macOS / Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Windows PowerShell
   # venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
